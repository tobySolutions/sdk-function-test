# Fleek SDK

The Fleek-Platform SDK provides an unified interface to help you quickly build applications that leverage our Fleek Services.

It's distributed as an ESM module for Web browsers, or CJS module for NodeJs Server applications. The server version provides a wider range of features, as some features are dependent of Native NodeJs modules.

To learn more about it read our documentation available [here](https://fleek.xyz/docs).

## Requirements

- NodeJs as runtime
- NPM, Yarn to install the CLI as a client, or PNPM for development

## Installation

Install the package by executing:

```sh
npm install @fleek-platform/sdk
```

## Basic usage

The following provides a basic example of how to import the [web browser](###browser) or [node version](###nodejs) into your project and run a few simple commands.

For a complete description, read our documentation [here](https://fleek.xyz/docs).

### Browser

The browser version is meant for applications that should run in a web browser and do not require NodeJs native modules.

Start by importing the web version from our SDK.

```ts
import { FleekSdk } from '@fleek-platform/sdk/browser';
const sdk = new FleekSdk({
  personalAccessToken: '<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>',
});
```

Alternatively, omit the `/browser` path, as it'll default to the web version due to retroactive support. It's recommended to specify the desired target for clarity.

```ts
import { FleekSdk }from '@fleek-platform/sdk';
```

üí°The `<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>` can be obtained by utilizing the `@fleek-platform/cli`, learn more about it [here](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli).

### NodeJs

For NodeJs projects import the distribution under the path `@fleek-platform/sdk/node`. This is a commonjs distribution (CJS), suitable for NodeJs environments. The Nodejs version has a wider feature support due to some features requiring features such as the file system, etc.

Use the following import statement:

```ts
import { FleekSdk } from '@fleek-platform/sdk/node';
```

If you don't specify the `/node` path, it'll import the client version (web), that has a narrower feature set.

Here's an example where we import the `FleekSdk`, the `PersonalAccessTokenService` and get the applications list.

```ts
import { FleekSdk, PersonalAccessTokenService } from '@fleek-platform/sdk/node';

const personalAccessToken = '<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>';
const projectId = '<FLEEK_PROJECT_ID>';

const accessTokenService = new PersonalAccessTokenService({
    personalAccessToken,
    projectId,
});

const fleekSdk = new FleekSdk({
  accessTokenService,
});

(async () => {
  const res = await fleekSdk.applications().list();
  console.log(res);
})();
```

#### IPNS SDK Usage

```ts
const publishedName = await sdk.ipns.publishName();
```

## Details

### Stack

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) as runtime environment.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting.
- [Genql](https://github.com/remorses/genql) as type safe Graphql client.

## Development

1. Install NodeJS from [the official website](https://nodejs.org) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) dependency manager.
3. Install dependencies usign `pnpm i` from rootpath.
4. Prepare your changes.
5. `pnpm build`, and happy testing!

### Conventional commits

We prefer to commit our work following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) conventions. Conventional Commits are a simple way to write commit messages that both people and computers can understand. It help us keep track fo changes in a consistent manner, making it easier to see what was added, changed, or fixed in each commit or update.

The commit messages are formatted as **[type]/[scope]**
The **type** is a short descriptor indicating the nature of the work (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore). This follows the conventional commit types.

The **scope** is a more detailed description of the feature or fix. This could be the component or part of the codebase affected by the change.

Here's an example of different conventional commits messages that you should follow:

```txt
test: üíç Adding missing tests
feat: üé∏ A new feature
fix: üêõ A bug fix
chore: ü§ñ Build process or auxiliary tool changes
docs: üìù Documentation only changes
refactor: üí° A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
style: üíÑ Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...
```
